The rupee depreciated 9 paise to close at 89.96 (provisional) against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday (December 10), tracking a negative trend in domestic equities and sustained foreign fund outflows.


Forex traders said investors are in a wait-and-watch mode, awaiting clarity from the U.S. Federal Reserve before taking decisive positions.


Investors are also awaiting cues from the U.S.-India trade talks, which could boost the rupee in the coming days.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the rupee opened at 90.00, then fell to an intra-day low of 90.10 against the U.S. dollar and finally settled for the day at 89.96 (provisional), down 9 paise from its previous close.

On Tuesday (December 9), the rupee settled up 18 paise at 89.87 against the U.S. dollar.

"We expect the rupee to trade with a negative bias on weak domestic markets and FII outflows, which continue to pressurise the rupee. Delay in trade deal between India and U.S. may further dent the rupee," Anuj Choudhary, Research analyst, Mirae Asset ShareKhan, said.


Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday (December 10) said talks with the U.S. on the proposed bilateral trade agreement are progressing.

"Talks are continuously progressing with them. We are moving forward towards a bilateral trade agreement," he said.

A delegation led by Deputy U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Rick Switzer is in the national capital for two-day trade talks with his Indian counterpart Rajesh Agrawal.


The U.S.' chief negotiator for the pact, Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asia Brendan Lynch, will hold discussions with India's chief negotiator and Joint Secretary in the Department of Commerce, Darpan Jain.

Choudhary further noted that a weak tone in crude oil prices and a decline in the US dollar may support the rupee at lower levels. Investors may remain cautious ahead of the FOMC meeting decision. USDINR spot price is expected to trade in a range of 89.70 to 90.30.

Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 0.09% lower at 99.12.


Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, was trading 0.26% higher at $62.10 per barrel in futures trade.

On the domestic equity market front, the Sensex dropped 275.01 points to settle at 84,391.27, while the Nifty fell 81.65 points to 25,758.

Foreign Institutional Investors sold equities worth ₹3,760.08 crore on Tuesday (December 9), according to exchange data.

Benchmark stock indices Sensex and Nifty declined for the third straight day on Wednesday (December 10) to close at a nearly month’s low, dragged by a last-hour selloff in consumer durables, private banks and IT shares.


In a volatile session, the 30-share BSE Sensex dropped by 275.01 points, or 0.32%, to settle at 84,391.27, a level not seen since November 11. During the day, it hit an intraday high of 85,020.34 and a low of 84,313.62.


The 50-share NSE Nifty fell by 81.65 points, or 0.32%, to close at a month's low of 25,758. In the intraday session, it hit a high of 25,947.65 and a low of 25,734.55.

 Stock markets rebound in early trade after two days of slump

Among the Sensex constituents, Eternal, Trent, Bharti Airtel, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, UltraTech Cement, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharat Electronics Ltd, Larsen &amp; Toubro and Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles were the laggards.

However, Tata Steel, Sun Pharmaceuticals, ITC, NTPC, Reliance Industries, HCL Technologies, PowerGrid, and Asian Paints were among the gainers.

"Indian markets mirrored global caution, weighed down by persistent FII outflows, INR weakness, and uncertainty surrounding US-India trade negotiations despite ongoing discussions. In the near term, market direction will be influenced by central bank cues and clarity on trade developments," Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Ltd, said.


In Asian markets, Shanghai's SSE Composite index, Japan's Nikkei 225, and South Korea's KOSPI settled lower while Hong Kong's Hang Seng finished in the green territory.

Nair added that global equity markets experienced continued volatility due to rising Japanese bond yields and indications of Bank of Japan monetary tightening, which are fostering risk-off sentiments in emerging markets.

"Focus now shifts to the upcoming U.S. Fed meeting, where a 25 basis points rate cut is widely expected. However, internal divisions and mixed economic indicators may temper expectations for further rate cuts in 2026," he said.

European markets are broadly trading lower. Wall Street broadly ended lower in overnight deals on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) remained the net sellers of equities worth ₹3,760.08 crore on Tuesday (December 9), while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) bought stocks worth ₹6,224.89 crore.

Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, slipped 0.03 per cent to $61.92 per barrel.

On Tuesday (December 11), the 30-share BSE Sensex dropped 436.41 points to close at a nearly two-week low of 84,666.28. The 50-share NSE Nifty dropped by 120.90 points to settle at 25,839.65.
